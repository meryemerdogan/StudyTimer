        <p>StudyTimer is a timer to help students keep track of their study times. It's aimed to motivate students to study effectively and more.
            <br>It has a basic design aimed to increase concentration.
        </p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>When you continue as a guest and hit the start button it starts counting as long as you're online. 
            <br>But if you create an account you don't have to be online during your entire study session. Just start the timer and when you finish you can come back and stop. 
        </p> 
        <h2>Additional Functionalities & Advices From ME</h2>
        <p>
            You can also take notes before & during your study session. I personally use the notes section as a rewarding part. I put the links of stuff that I want to watch / read.
            Or unrelated stuff that came to my mind during my study hours. When I finish my session, I come back to the notes part and reward myself. But you can use it as a to-do list for your study session or in many others ways too.
            <br>If you have any other ideas please let me know via the feedback section. You can write it anonymously or write your name so that I can add it here!
        </p> <b>Looking forward to hearing from you! Enjoy your study session! </b>
